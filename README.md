## Module 4 Web-Quiz 
This weeks challenge was to make a timed webquiz app

# Description

-When I load the page user is presented with a window with rules and a button to start the game
- when start is selected a new container presents a question with 4 buttons to choose answer
- Unfortunetly this is how far I got.
- I would like the timer to start when player selects start
- Player would then be presented with multiple choice answers to questions
- When timer runs out player would input thier highscores into the memory
- After initials are put in player would be prompted to quit or play again

- Will be working with tutor to try and finish javascript logic to make a functional game, and resubmitting.
